      - Hello, I believe there has been a mistake made on the exchange rate for my card. Could you please check the official interbank exchange rate for me?
      - When I made a cash transfer abroad the wrong exchange rate was applied
      - How do you figure out the exchange rate? Can you explain why I got less money than expected?
      - Someone may have made an error in figuring out the rate of exchange. I should have received more cash than I did on my most recent withdrawal.
